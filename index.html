    <p>We are going to leave this project a little more open-ended,but if you feel like you need more guidance. we would suggest you use javascript to prompy the user for information and set these to variables.Then use these
      variables . Then use these variables to check for the four conditions to all be true.its up to you what the secret message
      is!</p>
